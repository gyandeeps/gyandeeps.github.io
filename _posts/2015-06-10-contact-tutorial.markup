The contact part of the index page is consisted of two elements:

  1. Text
  2. Your email address

You can modify its text from the contact.html file.
Then in the _config.yml set the email variable to your email.

Don't be afraid of Email Harvesting, write your email properly, and the page will perform javascript obfuscation.
